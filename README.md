Create Dataset 

### Description

We have been using various datasets in the course that are either model/toy datasets or collected in conditions fairly remote to local relevance. With the newfound API and webscrapping skills that you learned, this project challenges you to create a dataset revolving around a topic, problem, or theme of your choice, clean it, properly document it, and submit it to the Kaggle dataset repository. Curating and sharing a dataset is an integral part of your skills and practice as a data scientist that should not be overlooked!
